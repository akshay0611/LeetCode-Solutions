# LeetCode-Solutions 🚀✨

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! This is where I store all my LeetCode problem solutions, auto-synced using the **LeetSync** Chrome extension. Enjoy the journey of coding and problem-solving! 🎉

---

## ✨ Overview

- **Auto-Sync:** Solutions are automatically pushed here via LeetSync.
- **Organized:** Each problem gets its own dedicated folder.
- **Progress Tracking:** Check out the commit history to see my coding evolution.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Solve a Problem** 📝  
   Tackle a LeetCode challenge and submit your solution.
2. **Auto Sync** 🔄  
   LeetSync detects your submission and pushes it directly to this repository.
3. **Organized Structure** 📂  
   Each problem is neatly stored in its own folder along with any notes.
